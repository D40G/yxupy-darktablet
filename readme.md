                                                         Hello!

I was bored and just made this dark web inspired tablet thingy idk how to call it.. Made in like an hour :P
You can just jack cars whit it rn maybe later i will add something more cool...
Supports only QBCore rn.

The car will be locked when you complete the hack.
You will need to lockpick it to use it..
